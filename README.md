# SQL-Movies-data-analysis

In this project, I used data of the Internet Movie Database (aka IMDB) from this dump.sql https://github.com/nhuphan2155/SQL-Movies-data-analysis/blob/main/dump%20(2).sql
. This database has information about movies, TV series, actors, directors, etc.

I've used various SQL techniques such as JOIN, CREATE VIEW, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, AGGREGATION ...
